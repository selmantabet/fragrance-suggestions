#Project: Fragrance Suggestion Engine by Selman Tabet @ https://selman.io/
#This project is dedicated to the entire Fragrance Community in celebration of 
#Fragrance Day 2021, as well as in memory of Carlos Powell of BFL.

#The engine is primitive at its current state, as the implementation
#merely involves a simple tag-matching approach, feel free to help with this project.
