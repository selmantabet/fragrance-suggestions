# Fragrance Suggestion Engine by Selman Tabet @ https://selman.io/
It is a simple tag-matching fragrance suggestion program that I developed for personal use, but I would like to share it for the community to see and work with.

This project is dedicated to the entire Fragrance Community in celebration of Fragrance Day 2021, as well as in memory of Carlos Powell of [BFL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCKJhoBHK4Xs5zneLo5qFXg).

The program user would feed the engine with parameters such as the occasion, time of day and season, and the program would return a list of the best matching fragrances for the user to choose from their collection. The user's fragrance collection would be stored in a CSV file. My own personal fragrance collection CSV is included for reference. 
---
The engine is primitive at its current state, as the implementation merely involves a simple tag-matching approach, feel free to help with this project either by raising an [issue](https://github.com/selmantabet/fragrance-suggestions/issues) or by providing a [pull request](https://github.com/selmantabet/fragrance-suggestions/pulls).
